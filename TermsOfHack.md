What can I submit as a hack?
A Hack is when you take something and make it better! This is an open data competition so you need to reuse official open data in a clever and creative way.  



Entries could include, art, jewellery, a digital sign, a board game,  historic film pieces, a virtual reality game, internet of things (IOT), a digital sensor display, a 3D model, a visualisation of data, an informed article and of course some amazing web apps! We only limit you to your imagination.



Prize categories can help provide inspiration to shape your ideas, as can mentors sop don't be afraid to tap into the resources on hand for ideas.



It's only 46 hours, so many of concepts entered are prototypes, mock ups,  models, smaller scale artworks and even engineering design concepts from our maker community.   Of course we have had some very crafty teams deliver live apps within the time frame. Your proof of concepts should be showcased in someway in your  3 minute video submission.

Using Open Data
You will find the list of Official data available for the GovHack competition in the Official Datasets list. You must use at least one Official dataset to be eligible for prizes.  Official Data includes individual datasets featured and all data discoverable on official Government data portals that are published on the Official Dataset list.

You will need to Record the URL of the most prominent data you have used on your Hackerspace project page. Remember judges love to see their data reused :)

For each prize category you enter, please check the eligibility requirements to see if any specific data  needs to be reused to meet judges criteria.  To maximize your chances to win National and Local prizes we recommend you mash up National and Local official data, giving you a chance in as many categories as possible.

Some datasets listed on data portals may have additional resources available with further information on how to use the data or other supporting material. You are encouraged to download and use these resources.

Several competition goals require entries must use at least one of the datasets provided for this contest, but you are free to use data from the official GovHack list or other datasets as long as their licensing terms permit usage for this purpose. You may also use any publicly accessible web services as long as it does not incur a financial cost to use (private and subscription APIs are prohibited due to licensing issues and barrier to entry).

Eligibility for Prizes
A team can be one person or more.  We recommend teams that are 3 to 6  people is best.

To be eligible for prizes, individual entrants must be either an Australian or New Zealand citizen or a current Australian or New Zealand resident (this includes temporary student residents). It’s only fair – it is an Australian and New Zealand GovHack competition after all.  

At least one team member must be over 18 (Or a guardian must be registered as the Representative to facilitate prizes).

For all Virtual Team competitors you must be a resident of the state or territory to participate and have one team member who has attended an event over the competition weekend.

Judges expect entries to be primarily developed throughout the weekend of GovHack. If submissions are shown to have been worked on before the weekend, the submission will be ineligible for prizes. This does not include reuse or extension of existing software, libraries or data sets. Entrants may be members of multiple teams but each team must be registered separately and each team has one entry. There is no maximum team size.

No judges will be eligible to compete for prizes, and individuals from organisations or companies are also not eligible for prizes sponsored by their organisation. Mentors/speakers are eligible to compete for prizes, but judges reserve the right to disqualify a mentor/speaker if they perceive unfairness.

Nature of Submission
Don’t do bad things. This contest has been designed to demonstrate the benefit of open data and open government. Please participate in and engage with the contest in that spirit and in good faith. You must not include submissions that are:

potentially libellous, false, defamatory, privacy invasive or overtly political;
material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which would cause personal distress or loss;

Authorised materials

All code and APIs must be available under an appropriately open license that allows reuse, commercial use, remixing and redistribution. As the owner of the code you can of course fork that code and commercialise if you want, but to be eligible for the competition, the codebase and demonstration submitted must be open sourced. All other content submitted must be Creative Commons BY licensed. For instance you may choose to submit an incredible dynamic or static data visualisation as your team contribution.

The reason for the open licensing of code and content is because GovHack is about awesome outcomes that anyone can use and build on. Great innovation comes from building on the greatness of those who came before.

Entrants consent to GovHack representatives using their name, likeness, image and/or voice in any media for an unlimited period of time, without remuneration, for any publicity and marketing purposes.

US Government materials) or released under another, compatible Creative Commons license, the Free Documentation License, the MIT license or BSD license etc.).You can use non- Government data licenced for reuse, however remember this is GovHack so you must use some official Government datasets.

Right to remove
Submissions and comments will be posted live, but occasionally they may not make it through our anti-trolling and anti-spamming filters and may need to be moderated manually. We reserve the right to remove or not post any submission that reasonably appears to breach any of these rules.

Spirit Prizes
Each GovHack event crew will nominate  the Spirit of GovHack Award nomination from their event.  Spirit Prizes are not nominated by competitors in Hackerspace  This recognises an individual that displays the greatest spirit of GovHack, aka the best “hacker” ethos. This means the person who best helped others, shared, learned or applied their skills creatively or cleverly. Local Spirit award Nominations are in the running to win the GovHack State Spirit Award.  This award is a Golden Ticket to the GovHack Red Carpet Awards with flights and accommodation included!  Some Local event will also have some other spirit prizes to issue at the closing ceremony on Sunday.

Administration of Prize Awards
Each Prize Category includes details of the award that you are nominating.  Sponsors generously support the event with contribution to event running costs, awards nights and  prizes. The value of cash awards has been determined based on expected costs of the event as at 26 July 2016 and we are confident they are correct.  As Govhack is a not-for-profit community event GovHack Global Operations Team (GOT) reserves the right to  amend the value of the prize if the GovHack event has outstanding expenses that have not been covered by sponsorship.   Cash awards will be administered through GovHack GOT following the relevant awards nights and reconciliation of all  event related expenses.  If prize values are changed you will be notified accordingly. Development prizes are  administered  by the sponsor who has contributed the prize. GovHack event coordinators will facilitate an introduction following the relevant awards. GovHack GOT accepts no liability if benefits of development prizes are not delivered.
